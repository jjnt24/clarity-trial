Project: Student-Voucher
ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
The Problem in Indonesia:
In Indonesia, the culture of corruption and dishonesty often starts as early as school years. Lessons on honesty and accountability â€” values aligned with the principles of Web3 â€” are rarely instilled through the education system.

Current Solution & Limitations:
In the current system, teachers can distribute vouchers or tokens for students to spend at the school canteen. However, traditional systems can be manipulated, allowing dishonest behaviors to persist.

ðŸ’¡ Solution Overview
Smart Contract Solution:
With this system, teachers can issue blockchain-based tokens to students for use in the school canteen. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making it nearly impossible to falsify or manipulate balances. Over time, students will learn that dishonesty does not pay off, helping to eliminate the early seeds of corruption in Indonesia.

Value Proposition:

For Schools: Provides a transparent, tamper-proof system for managing student rewards and allowances.

For Teachers: Reduces administrative burden and eliminates disputes about token balances or transactions.

For Students: Encourages a culture of honesty, accountability, and financial literacy from an early age.

For Society: Plants the foundation for a generation that values transparency and integrity, contributing to long-term cultural change.

For Parents: Offers visibility into their childâ€™s spending and helps reinforce positive behavior.
